## **Summary**

---

As a Sr. Software Engineer at Deca Technologies, I developed tools and algorithms for semiconductor package design and electronics manufacturing, using Rust and Python. I further mentored other engineers in Rust, including best practices, modern techniques, and product architecture. I have a B.S. in Mathematics from Arizona State University, where I also led a volunteer project to create a software toolkit for biological research, teaching students how to program in R and Python, plan and manage agile projects, and document software. I have interests in computational math, computer science, and cybersecurity, and I hold a CompTIA Security+ ce certification. I am passionate about solving complex problems, learning new technologies, and contributing to innovative solutions.

Currently, I work as a validation engineer and technical auditor for Charles Schwab. I ensure technologies are appropriately utilized, documented, and deployed. I validate the team follows their stated operating procedures and assist teams in finding solutions to issues with their processes or technologies.
